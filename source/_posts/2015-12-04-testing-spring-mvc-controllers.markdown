Since Spring 3.2 (January, 2013), it is possible to test Spring MVC controllers without an external framework.
The goal of this article is to show how to test Spring MVC controllers using only Spring testing capabilities.

<!-- more -->

To do so, a very simple Spring Boot project will be used as a support. You can find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/nphumbert/demo-test-spring-mvc). The controller to test will first be introduced. Then, explanations will be given on how to test it.

## Controller

The controller that will be tested is showed below. It permits to do a search in a fruit list.  

```java
@Controller
public class ApplicationController {

    @RequestMapping(value = "/fruits", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String getFruits(@RequestParam(value = "search", required = false) String search, final Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("fruitBowl", search(search));
        return "fruits";
    }

    private List<String> search(String search) {
        if (StringUtils.isEmpty(search)) {
            return fruitBowl();
        }

        return fruitBowl().stream()
                .filter(fruit -> fruit.startsWith(search))
                .collect(toList());
    }

    private List<String> fruitBowl() {
        return asList("banana", "orange");
    }
}
```

## Test

The test class must be annotated with the following annotations: 

- `@RunWith(SpringJUnit4ClassRunner.class)` to benefit from Spring features in JUnit tests.
- `@SpringApplicationConfiguration(classes = DemoTestSpringMvcApplication.class)` to specify the configuration class that will be used during the test.
- `@WebAppConfiguration` to indicate that the Spring application context that must be loaded is a `WebApplicationContext`.

The entry point used to perform the tests is the class `MockMvc`. Thereafter, the usage of this class will be explained.

### Set up

The set up of the `MockMvc` class can be done as follows:

```java
@Before
public void setUp() {
    ApplicationController controller = new ApplicationController(); // 1
    this.mockMvc = MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup(controller).build(); // 2
}
```

First, the controller must be instantiated (`1`). Then, the mock is initialized using the static method `MockMvcBuilders.standaloneSetup()` (`2`). At this point, the mock is ready to test the controller.  

### Perform

The method `MockMvc.perform()` allows to simulate HTTP requests to the controller. For instance, a GET request is done as follows:

```java
mockMvc.perform(
    get("/fruits") // 1
        .param("search", "ban") // 2
);
```

The class `MockMvcRequestBuilders` provides static methods, such as `get` or `post`, to simulate HTTP requests on a particular endpoint of the controller (`1`). HTTP parameters can be added fluently to the request (`2`).

Furthermore, other static methods are provided by the `MockMvcRequestBuilders` class:

- HTTP verbs like `delete`, `put` or `patch`.
- `fileUpload` to upload binary files.
- Others ([documentation](http://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/test/web/servlet/request/MockMvcRequestBuilders.html)).


### Assert

MockMvc permits to add assertions to the controller's response.

```java
mockMvc.perform(get("/fruits")
    .param("search", "ban"))
    .andExpect(status().isOk()) // 1
    .andExpect(view().name("fruits")) // 2
    .andExpect(model().attribute("fruitBowl", contains("banana"))); // 3
```

Assertions are done with the `andExpect()` method. The class `MockMvcResultMatchers` provides static methods to do assertions on the HTTP status (`1`), the view asked by the controller (`2`) and on the model completed by the controller (`3`).

## Conclusion

The Spring test framework is a very powerful, complete and simple way to test Spring MVC controllers. Its fluent API allows to write elegant and yet precise tests.
