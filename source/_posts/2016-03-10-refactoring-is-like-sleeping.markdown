Bob is a developer. Bob has been asked to add a brand new feature to the application. Bob would like to take this opportunity to refactor a little bit the code because it doesn't respect the good practices that he learnt from the last Software Craftsmanship meetup. Bob has been told that he couldn't refactor because there is currently not enough time to do it and because he needs to produce. Bob says to himself that there is never enough time anyways...

Sounds familiar? Indeed, refactoring is often seen as an activity without any value. Other things in life can also seem worthless. There is one that takes almost a third of our lives during which we do literally nothing: *sleeping*!

<!-- more -->

The number of things that we could do if we didn't sleep! However, after a few days, even hours, unpleasant events would eventually occur. Without sleep, the most trivial tasks can become very difficult to accomplish and weird mistakes can take place (like pouring orange juice into your bowl of cereal). After a while, sleep takes suddenly over, which can lead to accidents (because of drowsy driving, for example).

In the same way, postponing refactoring harms the project. Developments may take much longer than necessary and bugs may occur in features very apart from those that have been modified. Moreover, there is a moment where refactoring imposes itself unexpectedly: code can no longer be modified without risking important regressions. This can happen at a critical time of the project and thus jeopardize it. At this point, the feared verdict may be rendered: "everything must be rewritten".

In general, regular refactoring is necessary to the good health of a project, just like sleeping every night is for ours. Thereafter, we are going to define refactoring in this context, when is it good to do it, how to prepare it properly and what to do if time is missing.

## What does refactoring mean?

According Michael Feathers, refactoring is "the act of improving design without changing its behavior".

It is not necessarily about changing a whole class hierarchy or about implementing a complex design pattern but it could be as simple as renaming a variable, method or class, extracting a private method in an external class, gathering the attributes of a method into an object, etc.

Furthermore, we also consider that adding tests to an existing code base is refactoring. Indeed, a testable code is a first step towards a better design.

## When to refactor?

The idea is not to try to fix the entire system every time. This would be unproductive and impossible to carry out. Also, it would be difficult to justify causing regressions in a portion of code too unrelated to the one that was supposed to be changed.

Refactoring is very efficient when it is targeted at the code that is related to the development of a feature. Moreover, it is preferable to refactor before adding new code in order to start on good bases.

## How to prepare it?

The first thing to do before refactoring is to ensure that there are tests that cover the code that is going to be modified. Tests permit to verify that refactoring doesn't generate regression. If tests are missing, they need to be added before starting.

Sometimes it might be impossible to test a portion of code. In this case, you can perform the minimal refactoring required for implementing the tests.

## What to do if time is missing?

If, like Bob, you lack the time, you must be pragmatic. It can be interesting to do small refactoring for each development. This allows to improve the design without consuming too much time and to prepare the ground for a larger refactoring.

## Conclusion

Refactoring is essential in a project and should be done regularly. It allows to ensure that new features could be developed within a reasonable time and to limit regressions by improving the design. Furthermore, it allows developers to (re)take pleasure to make the product evolve.

We would like to conclude with the boy scout rule that tells us we should always leave the code in a better condition than when we found it. The application of this rule leads to improving the overall quality of the code and to the reversal of the technical debt.
