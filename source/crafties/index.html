<a href="https://www.youtube.com/Crafties">Crafties</a> is a YouTube channel that I created to share good practices about software development (in French, with English subtitles). 
<br>You don't have to be an expert, theses videos are addressed to all the people that want to discover and practice them.

The code used to support these videos is available on <a href="http://github.com/nphumbert">GitHub</a>.
