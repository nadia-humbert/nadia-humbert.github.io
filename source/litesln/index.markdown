I started [LiteSln](http://litesln.com) to create simple and effective solutions that I find interesting to develop and helpful.

The first software I created is [Nano](https://nano.litesln.com). It is a free application to manage invoices and enforce their consistency using a numeration strategy that can be adapted to the country's legislation. Nano also permits to edit invoices with custom templates and to monitor performance through statistics.

Nano has been created to guide Honduran entrepreneurs through the significant changes that have been made recently to their legislation. You can also use it if you need to edit and print invoices anywhere in the world.

You can contact me [here](mailto:contact@litesln.com) and follow LiteSln news on [Google+](https://plus.google.com/115367093201467260566) (in English and Spanish), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LiteSln-438977382967030) (in Spanish) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKEMdz8YKL0-XlyDkLngKIQ).
