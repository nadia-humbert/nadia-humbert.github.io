I started [LiteSln](http://litesln.com) to create simple and effective solutions that I find interesting to develop and useful.

The first software I created is [Nano](https://nano.litesln.com). It is an application to manage invoices and enforce their consistency using a numeration strategy that can be adapted to the country's legislation. Nano also permits to edit invoices with custom templates and to monitor performance through statistics.

It is ideal for people that need to edit and print nominative invoices ensuring their consistency. It has been already adapted to the Honduran legislation in order to guide entrepreneurs through the significant changes that have been made recently.

If you're interested in [Nano](https://nano.litesln.com), you can try it for free during 5 days without any obligation at the end of the trial period. I'd love to have your feedback and to know better your personal needs on it.

You can contact me [here](mailto:contact@litesln.com) and follow LiteSln news on [google+](https://plus.google.com/115367093201467260566) (in English) and [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LiteSln-438977382967030) (in Spanish).
