I started [LiteSln](http://litesln.com) to create simple and effective solutions that I find interesting to develop and useful.

The first software I created is [Nano](https://nano.litesln.com). It is an application to manage invoices and enforce their consistency using a numeration strategy that can be adapted to the country's legislation. It also allows you to edit your invoices with custom templates and to monitor your performance through statistics.  
It is ideal for freelances, entrepreneurs and all the people that need to edit and print nominative invoices ensuring their consistency.

If you're interested in [Nano](https://nano.litesln.com), you can try it for free during one month until January 20, 2016. I'd love to have your feedback and to know better your personal needs on it.

You can contact me [here](mailto:contact@litesln.com) and follow LiteSln news on [google+](https://plus.google.com/115367093201467260566) (in English) and [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LiteSln-438977382967030) (in Spanish).
