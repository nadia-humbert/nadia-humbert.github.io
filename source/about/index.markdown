I'm an entrepreneur and I currently work as a software engineer and manager of my company. I create my own applications ([LiteSln](http://nphumbert.github.io/litesln)) and speak about software development on my youtube channel called [Crafties (in French)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZjAiQD5Wl_vLQPvzT6dl1g).

I am a very accesible person and enjoy to talk to people from all over the world. I speak French, Spanish, English, Portuguese and a bit of Italian.  
I love my husband, family, sports, music and programming.

If you want to know more about me, you can read the following comic. You can also contact me anytime [here](mailto:contact@litesln.com) and follow me on twitter [here](https://twitter.com/nphumbert).
