I'm an advisor to companies and an entrepreneur. I cofounded [Crafties](https://www.crafties.fr), a company that helps improve the health of IT projects by performing technical audits, training courses, coaching sessions, software development and other consulting activies.  

I also created a YouTube channel (also) called [Crafties](https://www.youtube.com/Crafties) and the [Lyon Kotlin User Group](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Lyon-Kotlin-User-Group/) to share software engineering good practices.

I am a very accesible person and enjoy to talk to people from all over the world. I speak French, Spanish, English, Portuguese and a bit of Italian. I love travelling, playing sports, learning and sharing.
