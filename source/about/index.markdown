I'm an entrepreneur and a freelance developer. I also create my own applications ([Nano](http://nphumbert.github.io/nano)) and speak about software development, particularly on my YouTube channel called [Crafties](http://nphumbert.github.io/crafties/).

I am a very accesible person and enjoy to talk to people from all over the world. I speak French, Spanish, English, Portuguese and a bit of Italian.  
I love my husband, family, sports, music and programming.

If you want to know more about me, you can read the following comic. You can also contact me anytime [here](mailto:contact@litesln.com) and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/nphumbert) and [Google+](https://plus.google.com/u/0/110353212984123491279).
