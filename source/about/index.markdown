I'm an entrepreneur and I currently work as a software engineer and manager of my company. I develop my own online solutions : [LiteSln]().

I am a very accesible person and enjoy to talk to people from all over the world. I speak French, Spanish, English, Portuguese and a bit of Italian. I challenge myself very often and I love sports, music and programming.

If you want to know more about me, you can read the following comic. You can also contact me anytime [here](mailto:contact@litesln.com) and follow me on twitter [here](https://twitter.com/nphumbert).
