I'm an entrepreneur and a freelance advisor to companies. I cofounded [Crafties](https://www.crafties.fr), a company that helps to improve the health of IT projects by performing technical audits, training courses, coaching sessions, software development and other consulting activies.  
I also speak about software development, particularly on my YouTube channel (also) called [Crafties](http://nphumbert.github.io/crafties/). Moreover, I created the [Lyon Kotlin User Group](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/Lyon-Kotlin-User-Group/).

I am a very accesible person and enjoy to talk to people from all over the world. I speak French, Spanish, English, Portuguese and a bit of Italian. I love travelling, playing sports, learning and sharing.
